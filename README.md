👋 Hi, I’m Adrian
- 👀 I’m interested in climate change and programming, especially in R.  
- 🌱 I’m currently writing my master thesis while working at the University of Bonn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything R related for the moment.
- ⚡ I started training as a physiotherapist, then switched to studying agricultural sciences and am now a technician at an institute at the University of Bonn. Some of the topics I have worked on during my studies include using drone and airplane images to categorize plants and weeds, and determining the safe chilling temperatures at which fruit trees can still flower and bear fruit.
