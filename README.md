👋 Hi, I’m Adrian
- 👀 I’m interested in climate change and programming, especially in R.  
- 🌱 I’m currently writing my master thesis while working at the University of Bonn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything R related for the moment.
- ⚡ I started becoming a physiotherapist, switched to agricultural science and now I'm a programmer. During my studies I worked - among other things - on classifying crops and weeds with drone and airplane images and determining the safe "chill portions" at which crops such as fruit trees can still flower and bear fruit.
